<p class="para1"><span style="color:slate Blue">Travel and tourism</span> is the largest service industry in India. It provides heritage, cultural, medical, business and sports tourism.To develop and promote tourism, maintain competitiveness of India as tourist destination and improve and expand existing tourism products to ensure employment generation and economic growth.Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring,business of attracting,accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year business andother purposes". Tourism in the country first affect the environment of the surrounding areas in tourists destinations.<br><br>
<justify>   Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.<br><br>
</justify>Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the late-2000s recession, between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€720 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% .People from the developed country go for tour in the developing country however people from developing country cannot go for tour in the developed country because of the low economy status. Tourism in the developing countries may be high because of the low cost tour and travel package. However, together with the various positive effects of the tourism in the country, there are various negative effects also. Tourism in the country first affect the environment of the surrounding areas in tourists destinations because of the collection of huge amounts of garbage materials such as bottles, plastic wastes, food materials,etc.
