<p class="p1">The growth in the India rural tourism market in recent years means that many Indian villages have now found a place on the tourist map. Not only does it provide the villagers with a much needed additional source of income, visitors are able to interact with them and gain a rare insight into their way of life. They say the heart of India lies in her villages. Here are some top ways of experiencing them. Rural tourism focuses on actively participating in a rural lifestyle. It can be a variant of ecotourism.<br> Many villages can facilitate tourism because many villagers are hospitable and eager to welcome (and sometime even host) visitors. Agriculture is becoming highly mechanized and therefore, requires less manual labor. This trend is causing economic pressure on some villages, which in turn causes young people to move to urban areas. There is however, a segment of the urban population that is interested in visiting the rural areas and understanding the lifestyle.Rural tourism allows the creation of a replacement source of income in the non-agricultural sector for rural dwellers.[citation needed] The added income from rural tourism can contribute to the revival of lost folk art and handicrafts.Rural tourism is particularly relevant in developing nations where farmland has become fragmented due to population growth. The wealth that rural tourism can provide to poor households creates great prospects for development.
