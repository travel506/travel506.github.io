<p class="p1">The hill stations are high-altitude towns used especially by European colonialists, as a place of refuge to escape the blistering summer heat and dust of plains during the British Raj. They are prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India.<br>
The Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of India. The famous peaks and ranges include the Kangchenjunga range in the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of Darjeeling and Gangtok as well as the Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand. The Shivalik range that also lies within the same region also has some famous hill stations that include Dalhousie, Kullu, Shimla, Nanital sahyadri and many more.<br><br>

Most of the hill stations in India were developed by the British around a central mall to get respite from the oppressive summer heat. Many have picturesque lakes as their focal point, making them excellent places for boating activities.
